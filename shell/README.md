# arrowkeytest

A simple script that reads one character at a time and which tries to
find out when an arrow key was pressed.

# crc32

CRC32 calculator for bash.

# dirwatch

Show new files/directories under the directory given as the first
argument. File contents is also displayed.

# functionrefactor

A tool to show how much functions in a file are similar to each
other. Similar ones (lower effort% value) are then good candidates for
refactoring.

# tarextractfile

Interactively extract a file or a directory from a gzipped tar
file. Needs bash 4.x for now.

# tictactoe

Classic tic-tac-toe in bash. Nothing new, but this one is
optimized/obfuscated as extremely as possible by bending all the rules
(that really shouldn't be used in scripts that require production
level quality). Tell me if you manage to make this even a character
shorter.
